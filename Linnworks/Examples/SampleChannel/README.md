#What is this
This is a sample application to be used as a Channel Integration for Linnworks.net. Channel Integrations can be created to provide a fully functional, embedded channel directly within Linnworks.net

#Setup Guide

1. Upload either application to your web server
2. Add the manifest.json to your application pointing to your webserver (changing the variables to point to your server) - You don't need to do this step if you have selected 'Channel integration' as the application type when creating the application.
3. Go to 'Linnworks.net -> Channel Integration' and begin to integrate your channel
4. Linnworks will poll your channel for sync updates every 10-15 minutes per user
