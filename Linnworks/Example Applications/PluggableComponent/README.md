#What is this
This sample combines a pluggable component with a native user interface (Read more about native user interface in the OrdersDashboard sample). Pluggable components allow you to inject functionality such as buttons directly into Linnworks.net pages where you can then call custom functionality.

In this example, we create a button in My Inventory which calls a dashboard that shows the stock of an item in pie charts.


#Setup Guide

1. Upload either application to your web server
2. Add the manifest.json to your application pointing to your webserver (change files variable).
3. Make sure to read through the guide for OrdersDashboard if you are unfamiliar with the setup of NativeUserInterfaces.
